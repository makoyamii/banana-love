This program is a submission to the Magical Mirai 2024 Programming Contest. 
- This program is a simple program that displays each lyric on the screen when uttered. 
- By clicking on each character, it will turn into a heart. By acquiring more hearts, the user can gain points in the scorebar to the left of the screen.

The title of this program was meant to represent Kagamine Len's associated food, banana. By turning the lyrics into hearts, it becomes "Banana Love". This program can be experienced without having to interact with it but the viewer can also have fun by creating hearts on the screen.
